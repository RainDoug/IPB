<h1>Dwelling Insurance in <?php echo $area;?></h1>

<p>We write polices that cover more than just your possessions. Dwelling insurance is insurance that covers the property itself, and can indemnify you as a landlord or homeowner. Often the figure at which the property is valued is as contentious as the amount of coverage that is required by your lending  institution.</p>
<p>Our trained agents can help make sure that you are neither underinsured nor over insured.  By carefully looking at your risks and liabilities,
we can make sure that you are fully protected without paying for policies and features that you do not need.</p>
