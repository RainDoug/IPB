<h1>Actual Production History (APH)</h1>

<p><b>Actual Production History (APH)</b> policies insure against yield losses due to extreme weather, insects, and disease. The producer selects the amount of average yield to insure—up to 85 percent in some areas—as well as percent of the predicted price to insure, between 55 and 100 percent of the crop price established annually by the United States Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency (RMA). If the harvested, plus any appraised production, is less than the yield insured, the producer is paid an indemnity based on the difference. Indemnities are calculated by multiplying this difference by the insured percentage of the price selected when crop insurance was purchased and by the insured share.</p>
