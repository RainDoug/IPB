<h1>Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR)</h1>

<p><b>The Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR)</b> pilot provides protection against low revenue due to unavoidable natural disasters and market fluctuations that occur during the insurance year. Covered farm revenue consists of income from agricultural commodities, including incidental amounts of income from animals and animal products and aquaculture reared in a controlled environment.</p>

<p>The AGR concept:</p>
	<ul>
    <li>Uses a producer's historical IRS tax form (Schedule F or equivalent forms) information and an annual farm report as a base to provide a level of guaranteed revenue for the insurance period;</li>
<li>Provides insurance coverage for multiple agricultural commodities in one insurance product;</li>
<li>Establishes revenue as a common denominator for the production of all agricultural commodities; and</li>
<li>Reinforces program credibility by using IRS tax forms and regulations to alleviate compliance concerns.</li>
	</ul>
