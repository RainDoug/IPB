		<h1>HR Connection Employee Communitcations Tool</h1>
        <p>HR Connection  is an online employee communications tool designed for employers. HRconnection   
		is similar to an intranet, except it is available to employees and dependents 24   hours a day, 7 days a week on the Internet.</p>
		<p>Employers can use   HRconnection to communicate important announcements, company contacts, policies   and procedures, the 
		employee handbook, and employee benefit plan issues.   HRconnection enables employers to effectively communicate employee benefit plan   
		options and address a variety of human resource issues. These capabilities help   to reduce routine and redundant questions, thereby 
		allowing HR managers to   concentrate on larger responsibilities and core competencies.</p>
